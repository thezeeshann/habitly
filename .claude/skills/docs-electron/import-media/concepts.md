Understand the foundational architecture of CE.SDK's asset system and how asset sources organize content across platforms.

Asset sources are CE.SDK's content delivery architecture. Instead of hardcoding asset knowledge into the editor, CE.SDK uses a modular system where any content can be provided through a standardized interface. This decouples what assets are available from how they're discovered and applied.

This guide covers the foundational concepts of asset sources. For implementation details, see the linked guides at the end.

## Asset Source Fundamentals

An asset source provides content to the editor through a common interface. Every source has a unique identifier (e.g., `ly.img.image`, `ly.img.sticker`) and implements methods for discovering and applying assets.

Sources support:

- **Query-based discovery** with pagination and filtering
- **Optional grouping** (e.g., sticker groups: "emoji", "doodle", "hand")
- **Metadata** including credits, licenses, and format information

Sources are content-agnostic—images, fonts, templates, and custom content all use the same pattern.

## Content Organized as Asset Sources

Asset sources handle virtually all reusable creative content:

| Category   | Examples                                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Media      | Images, videos, audio clips              |
| Graphics   | Stickers, shapes, vectors, icons         |
| Typography | Fonts, typefaces, text presets           |
| Colors     | Color palettes, spot colors              |
| Effects    | Blur types, filters, LUT effects         |
| Templates  | Design templates, page presets           |
| Custom     | User uploads, remote APIs, your own data |

Built-in sources include `ly.img.image`, `ly.img.sticker`, `ly.img.template`, `ly.img.typeface`, `ly.img.filter`, `ly.img.blur`, `ly.img.effect`, and more.

## Types of Asset Sources

There are three ways to provide assets to CE.SDK:

### Custom Sources

Implement the source interface to connect any backend—database, API, or custom system. Custom sources provide full control over discovery and application logic. Use custom sources when you need to:

- Connect to your existing content management system
- Implement custom search or filtering logic
- Control how assets are applied to the scene

### Local Sources

Managed by the engine with dynamic add/remove operations. Local sources are suitable for user uploads or custom collections that change during the editing session. The engine handles storage and retrieval.

### JSON-Based Sources

Pre-defined asset collections loaded from JSON files. All built-in asset packs use this approach. JSON sources are ideal for static content that doesn't change frequently.

## Asset Sources and the User Interface

Asset sources are backend providers—they don't know about UI. The connection between sources and what users see happens through platform-specific UI configuration.

On Web, asset sources connect to the UI through:

- **Asset Library Entries** — Group one or more sources for display, configure grid layout and preview
- **Dock Buttons** — Sidebar icons that open asset panels
- **Panel Navigation** — Entry → Source → Groups → Assets grid

This separation means you can:

- Show multiple sources in one UI panel
- Show the same source in different UI locations
- Change UI presentation without changing the source

## Cross-Platform Architecture

Asset sources use the `engine.asset` API consistently across all platforms (Web, iOS, Android).

All platforms support:

- Custom source registration
- JSON-based asset loading
- Local asset management
- Group-based organization
- Event subscriptions (source added, removed, updated)

Code patterns transfer directly between platforms with only syntax changes.

## Asset Structure

Each asset contains:

- **ID** — Unique identifier within the source
- **Meta** — URI, thumbnail, MIME type, dimensions, block type hints
- **Label** — Localized display name
- **Tags** — Searchable keywords (localized)
- **Groups** — Category membership
- **Context** — Source reference for tracking origin

The engine uses metadata hints (`blockType`, `fillType`, `shapeType`) to determine what block type to create when applying an asset.

## Discovery and Application

Assets are discovered through queries supporting pagination, text search, tag/group filtering, and sorting. When applied, assets either create new blocks or modify existing ones. Sources can customize application behavior or use the engine's default implementation.

## Source Lifecycle Events

The engine emits events when sources change: added, removed, or contents updated. Subscribe to these events to keep UI synchronized with available content.

## Troubleshooting

Common conceptual misunderstandings:

- **Confusing sources with UI** — Asset sources are backend providers; they don't render UI. The UI (dock buttons, panels, grids) is configured separately and connects to sources.
- **Expecting sources to filter themselves** — Sources return all matching assets; UI configuration determines what's displayed to users.
- **Mixing source types** — Custom sources (your code), local sources (engine-managed), and JSON sources (static files) serve different purposes. Choose based on whether you need dynamic backend connections, runtime asset management, or static asset packs.

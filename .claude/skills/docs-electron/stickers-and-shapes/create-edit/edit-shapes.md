The `graphic` block in CE.SDK allows you to modify and replace its shape. CE.SDK supports many different types of shapes, such as rectangles, lines, ellipses, polygons, stars, and custom vector paths.

    await cesdk.actions.run('scene.create', {
      page: { width: 100, height: 100, unit: 'Pixel' }
    });

    const engine = cesdk.engine;
    const page = engine.block.findByType('page')[0];

    const graphic = engine.block.create('graphic');
    const imageFill = engine.block.createFill('image');
    engine.block.setString(
      imageFill,
      'fill/image/imageFileURI',
      'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_1.jpg'
    );
    engine.block.setFill(graphic, imageFill);
    engine.block.setWidth(graphic, 100);
    engine.block.setHeight(graphic, 100);
    engine.block.appendChild(page, graphic);
    engine.block.setPositionX(graphic, 0);
    engine.block.setPositionY(graphic, 0);

    await engine.scene.zoomToBlock(page, { padding: 40 });

    engine.block.supportsShape(graphic); // Returns true
    const text = engine.block.create('text');
    engine.block.supportsShape(text); // Returns false

    const rectShape = engine.block.createShape('rect');
    engine.block.setShape(graphic, rectShape);

    const shape = engine.block.getShape(graphic);
    const shapeType = engine.block.getType(shape);

    const starShape = engine.block.createShape('star');
    engine.block.destroy(engine.block.getShape(graphic));
    engine.block.setShape(graphic, starShape);
    /* The following line would also destroy the currently attached starShape */
    // engine.block.destroy(graphic);

    const allShapeProperties = engine.block.findAllProperties(starShape);
    engine.block.setInt(starShape, 'shape/star/points', 5);
  }
}

export default Example;
```

Similarly to blocks, each shape object has a numeric ID which can be used to query and modify its properties.

## Accessing Shapes

To query whether a block supports shapes, use the `engine.block.supportsShape(id)` API. Currently, only the `graphic` design block supports shape objects. To query the shape of a design block, first create a shape and set it, then call `engine.block.getShape(id)`. You can pass the returned result into other APIs to query more information about the shape, such as its type via `engine.block.getType(id)`.

```typescript highlight-accessShapes
    engine.block.supportsShape(graphic); // Returns true
    const text = engine.block.create('text');
    engine.block.supportsShape(text); // Returns false

    const rectShape = engine.block.createShape('rect');
    engine.block.setShape(graphic, rectShape);

    const shape = engine.block.getShape(graphic);
    const shapeType = engine.block.getType(shape);
```

## Replacing Shapes

When replacing a shape, remember to destroy the previous shape object if you don't intend to use it further. Shape objects that are not attached to a design block will never be automatically destroyed.

```typescript highlight-replaceShape
const starShape = engine.block.createShape('star');
engine.block.destroy(engine.block.getShape(graphic));
engine.block.setShape(graphic, starShape);
/* The following line would also destroy the currently attached starShape */
// engine.block.destroy(graphic);
```

Destroying a design block will also destroy its attached shape block (shown in the commented line).

## Shape Properties

Just like design blocks, shapes with different types have different properties that you can query and modify via the API. Use `engine.block.findAllProperties(id)` to get a list of all properties of a given shape.

```typescript highlight-getProperties
const allShapeProperties = engine.block.findAllProperties(starShape);
```

For the star shape in this example, the call returns an array including properties like `"shape/star/innerDiameter"` and `"shape/star/points"`.

Once we know the property keys of a shape, we can use the same APIs as for design blocks to modify those properties. For example, we can use `engine.block.setInt()` to change the number of points of the star to five.

```typescript highlight-modifyProperties
engine.block.setInt(starShape, 'shape/star/points', 5);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Shape Not Changing

- Verify the block supports shapes: `engine.block.supportsShape(block)` must return `true`
- Check that the shape was created successfully and has a valid ID
- Ensure the shape is assigned to the block using `engine.block.setShape()`

### Property Modification Not Working

- Confirm you're using the correct property key (use `findAllProperties()` to discover them)
- Verify you're using the right setter method: `setInt()` for integers, `setFloat()` for floats, `setString()` for strings
- Check that the property exists for that shape type (e.g., `shape/star/points` only exists on star shapes)

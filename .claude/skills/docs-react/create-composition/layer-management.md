Design elements in CE.SDK are organized in a hierarchical parent-child structure. Children of a block are rendered in order, with the last child appearing on top. This layer stack model gives you precise control over how elements overlap and interact visually.

This guide covers how to navigate the block hierarchy, reorder elements in the layer stack, toggle visibility, and manage block lifecycles through duplication and deletion.

## Creating Visual Blocks

To demonstrate layer ordering, we create colored rectangles that overlap on the canvas. Each block is created using `engine.block.create()` and configured with a shape, fill color, dimensions, and position.

```typescript highlight=highlight-create-block
// Create a colored rectangle
const redRect = engine.block.create('graphic');
engine.block.setShape(redRect, engine.block.createShape('rect'));
const redFill = engine.block.createFill('color');
engine.block.setFill(redRect, redFill);
engine.block.setColor(redFill, 'fill/color/value', {
  r: 0.9,
  g: 0.2,
  b: 0.2,
  a: 1
});
engine.block.setWidth(redRect, 180);
engine.block.setHeight(redRect, 180);
engine.block.setPositionX(redRect, 220);
engine.block.setPositionY(redRect, 120);
```

## Navigating the Block Hierarchy

CE.SDK organizes blocks in a parent-child tree structure. Every block can have one parent and multiple children. Understanding this hierarchy is essential for programmatic layer management.

### Getting a Block's Parent

We retrieve the parent of any block using `engine.block.getParent()`. This returns the parent's block ID, or null if the block has no parent (such as the scene root).

```typescript highlight=highlight-get-parent
// Get the parent of a block
const parent = engine.block.getParent(redRect);
console.log('Parent of red rectangle:', parent);
```

Knowing a block's parent helps you understand where it sits in the hierarchy and enables operations like reparenting or finding sibling blocks.

### Listing Child Blocks

We get all direct children of a block using `engine.block.getChildren()`. Children are returned sorted in their rendering order, where the last child renders in front of other children.

```typescript highlight=highlight-get-children
// Get all children of the page
const children = engine.block.getChildren(page);
console.log('Page children (in render order):', children);
```

This method is useful for iterating through all elements on a page or within a group.

## Adding and Positioning Blocks

When you create a new block, it exists independently until you add it to the hierarchy. There are two ways to attach blocks to a parent: appending to the end or inserting at a specific position.

### Appending Blocks

We add a block as the last child of a parent using `engine.block.appendChild()`. Since the last child renders on top, the appended block becomes the topmost element.

```typescript highlight=highlight-append-child
// Add blocks to the page - last appended is on top
engine.block.appendChild(page, redRect);
engine.block.appendChild(page, greenRect);
engine.block.appendChild(page, blueRect);
```

When you append multiple blocks in sequence, each new block appears in front of the previous ones.

### Inserting at a Specific Position

We insert a block at a specific index in the layer stack using `engine.block.insertChild()`. Index 0 places the block at the back, behind all other children.

```typescript highlight=highlight-insert-child
// Insert a new block at a specific position (index 0 = back)
const yellowRect = engine.block.create('graphic');
engine.block.setShape(yellowRect, engine.block.createShape('rect'));
const yellowFill = engine.block.createFill('color');
engine.block.setFill(yellowRect, yellowFill);
engine.block.setColor(yellowFill, 'fill/color/value', {
  r: 0.95,
  g: 0.85,
  b: 0.2,
  a: 1
});
engine.block.setWidth(yellowRect, 180);
engine.block.setHeight(yellowRect, 180);
engine.block.setPositionX(yellowRect, 160);
engine.block.setPositionY(yellowRect, 60);
engine.block.insertChild(page, yellowRect, 0);
```

This gives you precise control over where new elements appear in the stacking order.

### Reparenting Blocks

When you add a block to a new parent using `appendChild()` or `insertChild()`, it is automatically removed from its previous parent. This makes reparenting operations straightforward without needing to manually detach blocks first.

## Changing Z-Order

Once blocks are in the hierarchy, you can change their stacking order without removing and re-adding them. CE.SDK provides four methods for z-order manipulation.

### Bring to Front

We move an element to the top of its siblings using `engine.block.bringToFront()`. This gives the block the highest stacking order among its siblings.

```typescript highlight=highlight-bring-to-front
// Bring the red rectangle to the front
engine.block.bringToFront(redRect);
console.log('Red rectangle brought to front');
```

### Send to Back

We move an element behind all its siblings using `engine.block.sendToBack()`. This gives the block the lowest stacking order among its siblings.

```typescript highlight=highlight-send-to-back
// Send the blue rectangle to the back
engine.block.sendToBack(blueRect);
console.log('Blue rectangle sent to back');
```

### Move Forward One Layer

We move an element one position forward using `engine.block.bringForward()`. This swaps the block with its immediate sibling in front.

```typescript highlight=highlight-bring-forward
// Move the green rectangle forward one layer
engine.block.bringForward(greenRect);
console.log('Green rectangle moved forward');
```

### Move Backward One Layer

We move an element one position backward using `engine.block.sendBackward()`. This swaps the block with its immediate sibling behind.

```typescript highlight=highlight-send-backward
// Move the yellow rectangle backward one layer
engine.block.sendBackward(yellowRect);
console.log('Yellow rectangle moved backward');
```

These incremental operations are useful for fine-tuning the layer order without jumping to extremes.

## Controlling Visibility

Visibility allows you to temporarily hide elements without removing them from the scene. Hidden elements remain in the hierarchy and preserve their properties, but are not rendered.

### Checking and Toggling Visibility

We query the current visibility state using `engine.block.isVisible()` and change it using `engine.block.setVisible()`.

```typescript highlight=highlight-visibility
    // Check and toggle visibility
    const isVisible = engine.block.isVisible(blueRect);
    console.log('Blue rectangle visible:', isVisible);

    // Hide the blue rectangle temporarily
    engine.block.setVisible(blueRect, false);
    console.log('Blue rectangle hidden');

    // Show it again for the final composition
    engine.block.setVisible(blueRect, true);
    console.log('Blue rectangle shown again');
```

Visibility is useful for creating before/after comparisons, hiding elements during editing, or implementing show/hide functionality in your application.

## Managing Block Lifecycle

CE.SDK provides methods for duplicating blocks to create copies and destroying blocks to remove them permanently.

### Duplicating Blocks

We create a copy of a block and all its children using `engine.block.duplicate()`. By default, the duplicate is attached to the same parent as the original.

```typescript highlight=highlight-duplicate
// Duplicate a block
const duplicateGreen = engine.block.duplicate(greenRect);
engine.block.setPositionX(duplicateGreen, 400);
engine.block.setPositionY(duplicateGreen, 300);
// Change the duplicate's color to purple
const purpleFill = engine.block.createFill('color');
engine.block.setFill(duplicateGreen, purpleFill);
engine.block.setColor(purpleFill, 'fill/color/value', {
  r: 0.6,
  g: 0.2,
  b: 0.8,
  a: 1
});
console.log('Green rectangle duplicated');
```

The duplicated block is positioned at the same location as the original. You typically want to reposition it to make it visible as a separate element.

### Checking Block Validity

Before performing operations on a block, we can verify it still exists using `engine.block.isValid()`. A block becomes invalid after it has been destroyed.

```typescript highlight=highlight-is-valid
// Check if a block is valid before operations
const isValidBefore = engine.block.isValid(yellowRect);
console.log('Yellow rectangle valid before destroy:', isValidBefore);
```

### Removing Blocks

We permanently remove a block and all its children from the scene using `engine.block.destroy()`. This operation cannot be undone programmatically.

```typescript highlight=highlight-destroy
    // Remove a block from the scene
    engine.block.destroy(yellowRect);
    console.log('Yellow rectangle destroyed');

    // Check validity after destruction
    const isValidAfter = engine.block.isValid(yellowRect);
    console.log('Yellow rectangle valid after destroy:', isValidAfter);
```

After destruction, any references to the block become invalid. Attempting to use an invalid block ID will result in errors.

## Framing the Result

After making layer changes, we zoom to fit the page in the viewport so the composition is clearly visible.

```typescript highlight=highlight-zoom
await engine.scene.zoomToBlock(page, { padding: 40 });
```

## Troubleshooting

**Block not visible after appendChild**: The block may be behind other elements. Use `engine.block.bringToFront()` or adjust the insert index to control stacking order.

**getParent returns null**: The block is not attached to any parent. Use `engine.block.appendChild()` or `engine.block.insertChild()` to attach it to a page or container.

**Changes not reflected**: The block handle may be invalid. Check with `engine.block.isValid()` before performing operations.

**Z-order not updating**: Verify you're operating on the correct block ID and that the block is in the expected parent context.

**Duplicate not appearing**: If `attachToParent` is set to false, the duplicate won't be attached automatically. Set it to true or manually attach the duplicate to a parent.
